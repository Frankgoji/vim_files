% Template for double-spaced essays in LaTeX

% To-do: make the document have the proper centered title, the proper beginning
% header, proper spacing (1-inch margins), font, and page numbers with last name
% in the top right corner. Also, something for good ellipses would be a good
% idea. Indenting has to be for each new "paragraph." Each indent a half-inch.

\documentclass{article}

    Hello World!
